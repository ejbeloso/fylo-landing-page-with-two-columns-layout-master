## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As a beginner, i found this project a little bit harder. I've tried different types of techniques on how to achieve the best result. It's like trial and error, and also don't rely an one referense or tutorial. What really helps me is the use of css grid and css flexbox. It is true that you need to be comfortable with css itself before jump into libraries. I feel so happy when I see the final result eventhough it's not that perfect.
